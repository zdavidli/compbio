Q1.  What is the probability density value (isovalue) necessary to encompass all conformers? 

To encompass every single conformer, an isovalue of 0.05 is needed. 
However, with an isovalue of 0.2, we encompasse all but 2 conformers. 

Q2. Which atoms tend not to have defined densities at this isovalue, high or low B factor atoms? 

High B-factor atoms.

Q3. How can there be a residue in the PDB file if there was no electron density seen?

Their positions can be predicted by minimum energy calculations, and hence we still see them in the structure. 
No electron density information is reported because there is too much residual disorder for these atoms 
(i.e., the atoms exist in so many conformations so that it is too smeared to make a coherent electron density map)

Q4. What is the difference between the two maps for LYS_15?


The second map has a greater radius around Lys 15 (showing that it occupies a greater space/more mobile) than the first map.


Q5. Write an explanation as to why LYS_15 is less mobile in the X-ray structure than in your simulation.

While many conformations are sampled in reality, the most highly sampled conformations have dominating effects, 
so that when crystallographers measure electrons and make the map, the map largely reflects these 
common conformations, and less mobility is reflected in the final structure. In our simulations, 
we get to see the rarer conformations that are hidden in the crystal structure due to the 
dominating effects of the often-sampled conformations, so we see more mobility in the video.
