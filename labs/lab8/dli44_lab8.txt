Q1. Which atom-atom contacts between the ligand and protein are important for binding?
Fill in the table below.

Ligand Atom         Protein residue/heteroatom              Type of interaction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C14, C15 (methyl)   PHE 195                                 Hydrophobic Interaction
O2 (C=O)            Zinc 365, TYR293                        Electrostatic Interaction (ZN), Hydrogen bond
1H1 (O-H)           HIS 129                                 Hydrogen bond
H1 (N-H)            HIS 130                                 Hydrogen bond

Q2. Does the lowest energy cluster include the X-ray ligand conformation, or
does the most sampled configuration contain the X-ray conformation?

They are the same in my simulation, and it contains the X-ray ligand conformation.

Q3. Are all of the ligand-protein interactions you identified above as
being important satisfied in the conformations from the best cluster?

Yes.

Q4. Which apoprotein sidechains have VDW clash with the ligand?

PHE195, MET261, PHE139, TYR293 have clashes with the ligand.
