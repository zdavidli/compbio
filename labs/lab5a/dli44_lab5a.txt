Q4. How many configurations do you expect to be in the trajectory?

2500000 steps with configurations every 2500 steps means I expect 1000 configurations.

Q5. Why does 2500000 steps equate to 5 ns?

If each configuration is every 2500 steps which is equal to 5ps, then 2500000 steps is equal to 
5000 ps or 5ns.
