Q1. Are residues linked by backbone hydrogen bonds highly correlated?

Yes.

Q2. Why donâ€™t we see high correlation between residues i and i+1?

No, becuase the network.config files excludes adjacent residues (residues i and i+1)

Q3. Does each secondary structural element (helix, sheet) have its own unique cluster?

No, in some cases the structural elements are part of larger clusters.

Q4. What other results did you obtain in this class that showed heterogeneity of secondary structure dynamics?

Within a secondary structure, we learned that there can be high dihedral angular 
deviation between residues leading to heterogeneous secondary structure dynamics

Q5. Are these three residues in different communities in your VMD display?

Yes.

Q6. Did you find only covalent, only non-covalent, or both types of connection between correlated residues?

Only covalent.

Q7. Did you find only covalent, only non-covalent, or both types of connection between correlated residues?

Only non-covalent.
