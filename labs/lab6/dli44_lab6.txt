Q1. Are residues linked by backbone hydrogen bonds highly correlated?

Q2. Why donâ€™t we see high correlation between residues i and i+1?

Q3. Does each secondary structural element (helix, sheet)
have its own unique cluster?

Q4. What other results did you obtain in this class that showed heterogeneity
of secondary structure dynamics?

Q5. Are these three residues in different communities in your VMD display?

Q6. Did you find only covalent, only non-covalent, or both types of connection
between correlated residues?
