1. What is the difference between ordinary and partial differential equations?

Ordinary differential equations are differential equations that involve
derivatives in one variable, while partial differential equations have
(partial) derivatives with respect to multiple variables.

2. What part of the reaction scheme determines that the reaction goes to
100% completion rather than some equilibrium ratio of [S]/[P]?

The absence of the reaction k_(-3) from E -> EP means the reaction will
go to 100% completion and not an equilibrium ratio of [S]/[P].
This is from our assumption that once a product molecule is released
from the enzyme that dissociation is irreversible.


3. What are the initial concentrations of substrate (S0) and enzyme (E0)?

S0 starts at 50 µM and E0 starts at 1.0 µM.

4. How many enzyme molecules are present in the simulation?

If 50 µM of substrate means about 301 substrate molecules, then
1 µM of enzymes should mean about 6 enzyme molecules.

5. What number is assigned to the y variable for state P?

y(i) is assigned a value of 4 if the state is P.

6. Why do the ES and EP curves alternate between zero and some value?

Because there are only 6 enzyme molecules to start with, and it's a
discrete simulation, so there will be states of the system with 0
molecules of ES and EP.

7. How many substrate molecules are you starting with now?

I start with around 30,110 substrate molecules now.

8. Does your plot recapitulate the plot from the deterministic simulation?

Yes, they're basically the same after scaling the system by a factor
of 100.

9. From a comparison of the relative rate constants creating and eliminating
ES versus the creation and elimination of EP, which species should have
the longer lifetime?

EP is created at a rate of 1.0 s^-1 and eliminated at a rate of 0.54 s^-1,
while ES is created at a rate of 0.6 s^-1 and eliminated at a rate of 3.0 s^-1
so EP should have a longer lifetime.

10. Enter the complete commands you used in your lab report.

grep -v 'Time' TaggedParticle.txt | awk '{print $3}' > ES.dat
grep -v 'Time' TaggedParticle.txt | awk '{print $4}' > EP.dat

11. From inspection of the plots that appear, and values that are printed
to the command window, which species, ES or EP, has the longer lifetime?
