Q1. How many conformations will this produce?

If we run the program for 25000 cycles and save a conformation
every 50th cycle, we will have 25000/50 = 500 conformations

Q2. Is a helical conformation sampled?

Yes, a helical conformation is sampled.

Q3. Which move type is accepted more often, Helix or Strand(Sheet)?

Helix move types are accepted more often, with no residue dipping below
2000 acceptances, but sheet moves mostly have fewer than 2000 acceptances.

Q4. How are the two simulations different? Why?

The simulations were very different since the polyvaline stayed in a
strand conformation basically the whole time.

They would be different because polyvaline has more conformational freedom
in the side chains so polyvaline biases more toward strand conformation,
whereas the polyalanine biases more toward helix conformation.
Looking in the log file, I noticed that very few helix moves were accepted
and many strand moves were accepted.

Q5. Was the above hypothesis correct?

Our hypothesis was that polyvaline biases the conformational distribution
away from helix compared to polyalanine. Because polyvaline had fewer
helix acceptances and more strand/sheet acceptances, it seems that
the conformations are biased more toward strand and away from helix.

Q6. Which force field potential, if any, generated more compact structures on
average? Give the average Rg for each FF in your answer.

Q7. Which force field potential, if any, generated the most compact minimal energy
structure? Give the Rg for the minimal energy structure for each FF potential.

Q8. How are these two structures different with respect to the number of H-bonds
and positions of leucine side chains?

Q9. How, then, does one bias hydrophobic side chains away from the protein
surface toward the interior in "state of the art" protein simulations?

Q10. Based on your results, which type of interaction, hydrogen bonding or
hydrophobic effects, is more important for the initial folding of proteins?
