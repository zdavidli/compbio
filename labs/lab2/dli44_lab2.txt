Q1.
The isolated plus signs are waters.

Q2. Is there electron density information for all residues of the protein model?

There is electron density information for many but not all residues.
For instance, the residue (94) does not have complete electron density information.

Q3. Now is there electron density information for all atoms of all the residues
of the protein model?

There are a lot more of the residues with electron density information,
but it's still not complete.

Q4. What are defining characteristics of the residues that do not have electron
density?

The parts that don't have electron density information are glutamate,
which are highly polar and thus are very mobile. This means the electron density
map is highly smeared and can't be determined well.

Q5. How were the conformations of these sidechains obtained if there is no
density to indicate its conformation?

A side chain conformation is chosen by crystallographers arbitrarily.

Q6. Stop the movie, query the identity of two hydrogen bonded atoms and enter
the Info) records as the answer to this question.

Q7. In general, do the individual water-protein hydrogens bonds persist
for a longer or shorter time than the protein-protein hydrogen bonds?

They persist for a shoter time - in the movie the water molecules drift away
quite quickly and persist for shorter periods than the hydrogen bonds within
the protein.
