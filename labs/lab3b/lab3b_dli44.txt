Q1. What are the labels for the six columns starting with row 5?

The rows contain position information (X,Y,Z coordinates), and
X,Y,Z components of velocity.

Q2. What is the difference between the two energies given?

The difference between total energy and potential energy is the kinetic
energy.

Q3. What are the keywords at the beginning and end of each configuration?

Models have the line "MODEL" at the beginning and a line "ENDMDL" at the end.

Q4. How many configurations are in the trajectory?

There are 300 configurations.

Q5. The number of steps is tmax/delt = 15/0.001 = 15000, and we print out a configuration every nstruc = 50 steps.

This means we should see a total of 300 configurations.

Q6. Did you get the right number of configurations?

We got 300 configurations in our simulation, so this is right.

Q7. What is the average distance between an atom and other atoms in its first neighbor shell?

The average distance in the first shell (the first peak in the plot) is around 3.7-3.8.

Q8. Is this distance the same as the van der Waals distance?

Yes, it looks approximately the same as the van der Waals distance, since 1.12 * sigma = 1.12 * 3.4 = 3.80.

Q9. Do MC and MD give the same distribution of pairwise distances? IN other words, do both algorithms give the same average structure for the system?

Yes, the two algorithms return the same average structure.

Q10. Do both distributions of energies have the same Gaussian fit values?

They have very similar Gaussian fit values, but they are not identical.
